# RAAS
RAAS (Response-as-a-service) is a helm chart that deploys the `hashicorp/http-echo` server and allows you to specify a return and status code. This can be utilized in cases where you may need to point things like ingresses at specific endpoints to return specific responses instead of allowing default routing/behavior.
